This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).


This project follows the [React + Apollo GraphQL Tutorial] (https://www.howtographql.com/react-apollo/0-introduction/)

## Running the frontend

In the project directory run:

### `yarn install`
### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

## Running the server

Cd in the server directory and run:

### `yarn install`
### `yarn prisma deploy`
During the deploy step you should select a Demo server.<br>
### `yarn start`


This also runs a GraphQL Playground at [http://localhost:4000](http://localhost:4000) 

This tutorial is much more difficult than a four star half shell sudoku puzzle.
